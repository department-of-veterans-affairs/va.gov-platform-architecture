## Background

Numerous service accounts exist throughout the Platform, and there is currently no central tracking of them, nor consistent guidance on how they are created, approved, managed, and maintained. 

## Motivation

The proposed Service Account Guidance would provide guidance on how service accounts should be requested, approved, managed and maintained.

## Design

The proposed [Service Account Guidance](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PSEC/pages/2222588013/Service+Account+Guidance) is a document in the PSEC Confluence page.

## Risks

* Existing service accounts that are already in use may not conform to this new guidance.  Would require additional effort to backfill compliance to the guidance.
* Specific guidance may potentially not be possible to achieve for some service accounts, depending on unique circumstances.

## Alternatives

* A Service Account Guidance in some form is necessary, the alternative to the currently proposed one would be changes to the content of the document based on comments and input from others.
