## Background

Explain the current state. What is the problem? What needs to happen? Provide enough background for someone new to the problem space to understand this decision. Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.

## Motivation

Which problem(s) does this solve? Why? Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.
Example: Framework XYZ is a modern, well-known, web rendering framework. It is easy to learn, easy to use, and provides high-performance web rendering. etc

## Design

Explain the proposed design in enough detail so that a team member will fully understand the implementation. Include a diagram (in the `images` dir) as needed to convey your plans. Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.

## Risks

List the risks of this approach

* There are always risks. What are the risks of this solution?
