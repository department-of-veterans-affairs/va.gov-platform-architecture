## Background


Currently permissions to repos such as va.gov-team, vets-website, and vets-api are largely handled through the `vets.gov-write` [team](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vets-gov-write). This team includes a mixture of individual [members](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vets-gov-write/members) as well as [child teams](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vets-gov-write/teams).

This makes management of users and permissions difficult for multiple reasons:
1. The roles of various individual users added to the `vets.gov-write` team are unclear and difficult to track.
1. Onboarding and offboarding of individual users has to be performed by maintainers of `vets.gov-write` creating maintainence burden.
1. Refined permissions cannot be applied to various level groupings such as "all Platform teams" or "all VFS teams"

We need to restructure our Github Teams to improve clarity, reduce manual overhead, and increase granularity of permissions.


## Motivation

Which problem(s) does this solve? Why? Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.
Example: Framework XYZ is a modern, well-known, web rendering framework. It is easy to learn, easy to use, and provides high-performance web rendering. etc

## Design

Explain the proposed design in enough detail so that a team member will fully understand the implementation. Include a diagram (in the `images` dir) as needed to convey your plans. Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.

### Phase 1 - Establish structure

First, use the existing `vets.gov-write` team and ensure all users are represented in a child team.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph vets.gov-write
        subgraph va.gov-platform-teams
            platform-leadership
            platform-governance
            platform-infrastructure
            platform-release-tools
        end
        subgraph va.gov-vfs-teams
            vfs-example-a
            vfs-example-b
            vfs-example-c
        end
    end
```

### Phase 2 - Refine permissions

- Add any Platform specific permissions to `va.gov-platform-teams`
- and `va.gov-vfs-teams` that are needed.


### Phase 3
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph va.gov-all-teams
        subgraph va.gov-platform-teams
            platform-leadership
            platform-governance
            platform-infrastructure
            platform-release-tools
        end
        subgraph va.gov-vfs-teams
            vfs-example-a
            vfs-example-b
            vfs-example-c
        end
    end
```
