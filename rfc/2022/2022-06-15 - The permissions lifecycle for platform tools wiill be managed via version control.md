## Background
In order to fully leverage the powerful authorization services of Keycloak, the platform tool integrated into Keycloak must be configured with a set of permissions. Permissions are composed of roles, resources, scopes, policies, and various other attributes. AMT has recommended a format and schema for defining these permissions<sub>[[RFC6]](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AMT/pages/2142011842/RFC+6+AMT+integrators+can+describe+fine-grained+permissions+using+JSON)</sub>.

Currently, no holistic process has been defined to direct the flow from permissions generation to permissions integration. The intent of this RFC is to gather feedback and criticism of a proposed process for managing the lifecycle of permissions of a platform tool.

## Motivation
Though AMT has defined a schema for describing permissions, t1xhere is no prescribed process for the managing the lifecycle of a platform tool's permissions. Because of the lack of a permissions lifecycle management process, integrations with Keycloak have led to lengthy manual integrations. Defining and implementing a process using existing and popular tooling will reduce confusion, streamline the process, and pave the way for automation opportunities in the near future.
