The title is what you want comments on. Use the active voice in a future tense.

## Background
In order to fully leverage the powerful authorization services of Keycloak, the platform tool integrated into Keycloak must be configured with a set of permissions. Permissions are composed of roles, resources, scopes, policies, and various other attributes. AMT has recommended a format and schema for defining these permissions[^RFC6]

## Motivation

Which problem(s) does this solve? Why? Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.
Example: Framework XYZ is a modern, well-known, web rendering framework. It is easy to learn, easy to use, and provides high-performance web rendering. etc

## Design

Explain the proposed design in enough detail so that a team member will fully understand the implementation. Include a diagram (in the `images` dir) as needed to convey your plans. Use active voice, present tense, and decisive language.

## Risks

List the risks of this approach

* There are always risks. What are the risks of this solution?
* These are the things people will bring up in opposition to your idea or plans. Acknowledge them.

## Alternatives

List the alternative approaches

* There are always alternatives. What other alternative solutions were considered? Not considered?
* What are their strengths, weaknesses, risks? Why werenâ€™t they chosen?
* Do not allow bias of a solution to show in this section, ensure each alternative has been considering seriously or do not list it in this section

## Diagrams

Try to visually represent the proposal using a [diagram](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams). [Live editor](https://mermaid.live/)
